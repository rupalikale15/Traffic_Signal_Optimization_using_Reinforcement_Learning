# Traffic Optimization using YOLOv8 + SUMO-RL + PPO
# 🚦 Traffic Signal Optimization using YOLOv8, SUMO, and Reinforcement Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **intelligent and adaptive traffic signal control system** that integrates **computer vision**, **reinforcement learning**, and **traffic simulation** to overcome the limitations of conventional fixed-time traffic signals.

The system dynamically adjusts traffic signal phases based on **real-time traffic conditions**, aiming to reduce congestion, waiting time, fuel consumption, and emissions.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Traditional traffic signal systems operate using fixed signal timings and lack real-time adaptability. Such systems fail to respond effectively to fluctuating traffic demand, leading to congestion, increased waiting time, fuel wastage, and pollution—especially in heterogeneous traffic environments like India.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To design an adaptive traffic signal control system using Reinforcement Learning
* To simulate realistic traffic behavior using the SUMO simulator
* To use computer vision (YOLOv8) for traffic perception and vehicle counting
* To compare PPO with other RL algorithms such as DQN and A2C
* To evaluate system performance using training metrics and visual analytics

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system is structured into **three major layers**:

### 1️⃣ Perception Layer

* Uses **YOLOv8** for vehicle detection and traffic density estimation
* Converts raw visual/simulation data into numerical traffic states

### 2️⃣ Decision Layer

* Uses **Reinforcement Learning** (PPO as primary algorithm)
* Observes traffic state and selects optimal signal phase actions
* Learns policies that minimize waiting time and congestion

### 3️⃣ Simulation & Control Layer

* **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** simulates real-world traffic
* **TraCI** enables real-time control of traffic signals from Python
* Returns reward and next state to the learning agent

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Formulation

* **State (S):**
  Vehicle count per lane, queue length, waiting time, current signal phase

* **Action (A):**
  Selection of traffic signal phase (e.g., North-South green, East-West green)

* **Reward (R):**
  Negative waiting time and queue length to encourage smooth traffic flow

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

* **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** – Primary algorithm (stable & efficient)
* **DQN (Deep Q-Network)** – Baseline comparison
* **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)** – Performance comparison

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Simulator:** SUMO
* **Interface:** TraCI
* **RL Framework:** Stable-Baselines3
* **Computer Vision:** YOLOv8
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Visualization:** TensorBoard
